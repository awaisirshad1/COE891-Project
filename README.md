# COE891-Project
COE891 Final Project

## Overview
This project is a detailed testing of the `jsons` python library, using techniques like ISP, flow analysis (control and data), logic testing and mutation testing.

## Development Workflow
Clone the repo to your local machine.
```
 git clone <url-of-this-repo> 
```

For your testing technique (ex. ISP, Mutation), create a branch with the technique as the name of the branch.
```
git branch <your-branch-name-here>
```

then switch to that branch using
```
git switch <your-branch-name-here>
``` 
or 
```
git checkout <your-branch-name-here>
```

Once you've done that, publish the branch to the remote repository:
```
git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name-here>
```

Now develop your test cases in your directory
